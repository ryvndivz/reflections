When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?
      You would want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your
      work locally when you would like to have others collaborate on your
      projects, or if you'd like to work on the same project you created from a
      different computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
      Because you yourself being the decider on when it is best to pull
      changes you may have made is always going to be better than Git and
      GitHub trying to decide when you'd like to have changes pulled.
