When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?
      You would want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your
      work locally when you would like to have others collaborate on your
      projects, or if you'd like to work on the same project you created from a
      different computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
      Because you yourself being the decider on when it is best to pull
      changes you may have made is always going to be better than Git and
      GitHub trying to decide when you'd like to have changes pulled.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?
      clone will clone a repository that someone has already created to your
      local drive. A fork is a copy of someone's GitHub repository to your
      github profile account and when you pull that repository to your local
      drive it automatically creates a remote origin that you can than push
      and pull from. a branch is simply a commit or multiple commits that you
      can create outside of your master branch (your master branch is also a
      branch itself) for various reasons but ultimately any changes you make
      to your code in a branch outside of your master branch will use (or
      start with the original code you had) and allow you to make changes (
      additions or subtractions of lines of code) that will not effect your
      your master branch.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
      The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored
      locally is if you are offline and would like to work on it locally due
      to not having internet.
